They're all symptoms that result from the arousal of the nervous system. Whether you're getting ready for a date or preparing to give a speech in front of your peers, the physical sensations are very similar.",3
9,"Save Earth!","public","This is regarding environment.","If you’ve ever followed the news coverage of a major hurricane, you’ve probably already seen some real-world examples of how natural disasters can harm the environment. Power plants, gas stations and factories flooded by a storm surge can release toxic chemicals and other waste into local water sources — potentially killing wildlife or even making some areas uninhabitable.

Hurricanes also tend to accelerate coastal erosion. Storm tides can both pull and deposit massive amounts of sediment in or from coastal areas. Over time, this can threaten the stability of coastal structures and contribute to habitat loss. Particularly severe storms can also destroy forests, displacing animals.

Even slight damage to certain industrial structures can have a big impact. Oil pipelines are regularly damaged by landslides and earthquakes, sometimes causing them to leak crude oil, which can have a serious environmental impact. Amid the 2016 protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline, an expert called for rerouting due to the high risk of landslides along the construction path.",3
10,"Hurricanes are disaster!","public","This is about natural calamity!","If your company has a robust disaster preparedness plan in place, hurricane damage can be mitigated with good practice and insurance. However, many businesses aren’t ready for the potential problems these storms can cause — and in some cases, this may make things worse.

For example, wastewater ponds — which phosphate plants use to store acidic and somewhat radioactive waste produced by mining operations — can also have a major impact if disturbed or damaged by natural disasters. In 2004, Hurricane Frances caused massive waves in a pond on top of a phosphate plant in Riverview, Florida. This sent 150 million gallons of polluted water cascading into a stormwater ditch surrounding the plant.

At this point, the company opened a valve that released 65 million gallons of water from the ditch into the local Archie Creek. This polluted water turned the creek, which flows into the nearby Hillsborough Bay, acidic. Once it entered the bay, it had an immediate effect on the area’s marine wildlife. Mac Nipper, a diver and local of nearby Clearwater, told the Tampa Bay Times, “I walked the bottom for sponges and marine life, and it was a void … like it was burned out to nothing.”

You might not notice some of the environmental impacts right away.  Vehicles, barrels, boats and heavy equipment may also be flooded or crushed during the storm. This can release toxic chemicals, like fuel, antifreeze, solvents and lubricants, which may enter groundwater sources.",1
11,"Wildlife","public","This is about wildlife and how important it is.","Every year, California wildfires damage more than 70,000 acres of land. Some years, however, are much more severe than others. The  larger they are, the more serious of an environmental impact they’ll have.

In 2018, extreme wildfires swept across California after a spark from faulty electrical equipment set dry brush ablaze. Nearly 2 million acres of land was burned, destroying more than 22,000 buildings and causing greater than $3.5 billion in damage.

The smoke from these fires can cause drastic increases in air pollutants, seriously harming local air quality. The combination of heat and air pollution displaces massive numbers of animals, which may be stressed by human contact as they move into more populated areas. The wildfires also release significant amounts of carbon dioxide and destroy trees that would otherwise remove CO2 from the air.

The environmental impact of wildfires isn’t always negative. They are a natural part of many forest lifecycles. Small-scale fires clear away dead brush, leaves and other detritus from the forest floor, making way from new growth. This can sometimes offset the CO2 produced by these fires. Scientists typically don’t include the CO2 production of wildfires in their calculations on global CO2 levels for this reason.",1
12,"Covid 19 pandemic","public","About covid 19 pandemic.","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 

The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).

At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.",2
13,"Fashion and Beauty","personal","This is about trends and fashion.","Fashion designers may work full-time for one fashion house, as 'in-house designers', which owns the designs, or they work alone or as part of a team. Freelance designers work for themselves, selling their designs to fashion houses, directly to shops, or to clothing manufacturers. The garments bear the buyer's label. Some fashion designers set up their own labels, under which their designs are marketed. Some fashion designers are self-employed and design for individual clients. Other high-end fashion designers cater to specialty stores or high-end fashion department stores. These designers create original garments, as well as those that follow established fashion trends. Most fashion designers, however, work for apparel manufacturers, creating designs of men's, women's, and children's fashions for the mass market. Large designer brands which have a 'name' as their brand such as Abercrombie & Fitch, Justice, or Juicy are likely to be designed by a team of individual designers under the direction of a design director.",2
